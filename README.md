# Searching-Algorithm-Visualizer
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


This app lets you use various algorithms to find a path between source and destination nodes and visualizes the algorithm in the UI.

## Setup local repository
To use this app on your local system follow the following steps-
* Open the terminal and `cd` into location of your choice.
* Run `git clone https://github.com/codeValleyx/Searching-Algorithm-Visualizer`
* Then run `cd Searching-Algorithm-Visualizer`.
* Then `npm install`
* Then `npm run start`
* Then open any browser and in the URL bar, search `localhost:3000` 

You can now use the web app.

## How to use the app
* Use the sidebar on the left to place start node, end node, walls and weights on the grid.
* Choose a search algorithm on the top
* Click on `Begin!` button to start the visualization of the chosen algorithm.
* `Clear Path` clears the visualized or visited nodes of the grid.
* `Reset Board` resets the grid
